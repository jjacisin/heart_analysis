# heart_analysis

The goal of this repo is to gain practice with the following tools/libraries:

  1) Practice Visualizations using seaborn
  2) Create a model that best predicts heart disease in a given patient
  
    -- Classification Models to test accuracy
      -- Logistic Regression
      --
    --Stretch goal: Tune hyperparams of each model and describe the function of each.
